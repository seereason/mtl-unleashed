synopsis:           MTL classes without the functional dependency
description:
  Classes MonadState and MonadReader without the functional
  dependency from the monad to the contained type.  This allows
  more flexibility to extract bits and pieces of state based on
  type, but increases ambiguities that need to be resolved with
  extra type signatures.
